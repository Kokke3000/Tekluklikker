# TekluklikkerOnline:
The (public) github repo of TekluklikkerOnline

Tekluklikker is a small passion project to create a clicker game based on my school.
It's ran on github pages and might be updated in the future to add more features and fix bugs.

If you find a bug and would like to fix it yourself, i am open to pull requests and outside contribution to the project.
As long as the code seems okay and non-harmfull to the overall project, there is a good chance i will merge it.

You may not copy, distribute or use the code or any other assets in any way.
The code is provided as is, and so is the website, i am not liable for any problems arrising from it's use.
